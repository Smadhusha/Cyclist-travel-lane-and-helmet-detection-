# Cyclist-travel-lane-and-helmet-detection-
This project aims to detect if a cyclist is traveling on a cyclist travel lane &amp; wearing a helmet.  

A simplified method for the detection of cyclist travel lanes and helmets is proposed in this paper. 
This vision-based system is mainly divided into two different detectors. 
The first detector detects whether the cyclist in the input source is traveling on the dedicated cyclist travel lane. 
The second detector detects whether the cyclist in the previous input source has a helmet on his/her head.
